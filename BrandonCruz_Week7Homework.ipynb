    "##### *Qestion: In your own words, briefly explain Primary keys and Foreign Keys.*   <br> Primary keys are non null values that uniquely identify each record from a table. No other value can have that same ID. There is only one primary key per table and usually look something like \"nameID.\" Additionally, foregin keys are essentially primary keys but just from a different table. Foreign keys uses the values used in another table, to create a link between two or more tables. \n",
